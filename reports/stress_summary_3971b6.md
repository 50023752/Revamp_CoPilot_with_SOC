|             1 | What is GNS4 trend for last 4 months?                                                                                                                          | 100      |          0.89     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data contains all the correct data points. The row order is different, but this is acceptable as no specific ranking was requested. A minor floating-point difference (13.28 vs 13.27) is within the allowed tolerance.                                                                                                     |
|             2 | Give me top 10 dealer names that have the highest NNS3 percentage and cases are more than 30 per dealer? Show the number of cases.                             |   0      |          0.736667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data failed to provide the 'dealer_name' as explicitly requested by the user, returning 'supplierid' instead. Furthermore, the top result from the ground truth ('SAI MOTORS' with 5.56% NNS3) is completely missing from the candidate's output, leading to a mismatch in both the rows and the corresponding data values. |
|             3 | Show me the top 10 dealers where banking model has highest no hit percentage? application count should be greater than 30 and what is the approval percentage? |  33.3333 |          0.963333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 10 dealers, applies the filter for application count, and provides the correct percentages. The order of the last two rows is different from the ground truth, but this is acceptable as they have the same 'no_banking_hit_percentage' and no secondary sort order was specified.        |
|             4 | SHow me the bounce rate on 0 dpd for Assam?                                                                                                                    | 100      |          0.703333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly provides the bounce rate for Assam, which matches the ground truth value of 21.61. Although it omits the columns showing the underlying calculation, it directly and accurately answers the user's question.                                                                                                 |
|             5 | What is the rejection based on CIBIL score below 650 in the last 3 months? Month on month?                                                                     |  66.6667 |          1.03     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data is a perfect match to the ground truth. Although the row order is different, the data for each month is correct, and the evaluation criteria permit ignoring sort order.                                                                                                                                               |
|             6 | What is the rejection rate for applications where CIBIL score is between 300-650 in October 2025? Also list out the reason of rejections for these cases.      |   0      |          0.83     |              0 |             33.3333 | Error: 400 Unrecognized name: count_o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|             7 | what is the current 1-30 delinquency percentage of the portfolio in comparison with last year?                                                                 |  33.3333 |          0.846667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identified the current 1-30 delinquency percentage as 4.6, but it incorrectly calculated the value for the same period last year. The candidate's value is 3.4, whereas the correct value is 5.34.                                                                                                           |
|             8 | How many cases who were at 0 delinquency last year and now have slipped to 90+ ?                                                                               |   0      |          0.836667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate's aggregated count (60803) does not match the ground truth value (60734).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|             9 | Which state has the highest normalization rate for the current month in DPD BKT 1?                                                                             | 100      |          0.736667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data is a perfect match to the ground truth. It has the same number of rows, and all corresponding data values are identical. The difference in column names is acceptable.                                                                                                                                                 |
|            10 | Which state has the highest roll forward rate for the current month in DPD BKT 2?                                                                              | 100      |          0.736667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 5 states and their roll forward rates, perfectly matching the ground truth. The additional rows provided are considered helpful context for a ranking query and do not invalidate the answer.                                                                                             |

The candidate successfully identified a set of customers that fit the requested profile, thus passing the check based on the special rule.       |
