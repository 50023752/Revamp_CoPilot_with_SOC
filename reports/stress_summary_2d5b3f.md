The difference in row order is acceptable as the core data is correct.                                                                                                     |
|             2 | Give me top 10 dealer names that have the highest NNS3 percentage and cases are more than 30 per dealer? Show the number of cases.                             |  66.6667 |          0.8      |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 10 dealers, their total cases, and NNS3 percentages, matching the ground truth exactly. The inclusion of an extra, relevant column ('nns3_cases') is acceptable as it provides additional context without compromising the core answer.                                                               |

The set of dealers and their corresponding data points are identical to the ground truth.                                                                           |

It provides the correct state, total accounts, bounced accounts, and bounce rate percentage, fulfilling the user's request accurately. The difference in column names is ignored as per the evaluation criteria.                                                                           |

Month on month?                                                                     |  66.6667 |          1.04333  |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data includes an extra row for the month 2025-07, which is outside the user's requested time frame of 'the last 3 months'. The ground truth correctly provides only three rows.                                                                                                                                                         |

The ground truth shows 3.91% and 3.3%, while the candidate data shows 4.6% and 5.34%.                                                                                                                                                      |
|             8 | How many cases who were at 0 delinquency last year and now have slipped to 90+ ?                                                                               |   0      |          0.676667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate's aggregated value (60806) does not match the ground truth value (60734). The values are numerically different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|             9 | Which state has the highest normalization rate for the current month in DPD BKT 1?                                                                             | 100      |          0.756667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data is a perfect match to the ground truth. All rows and corresponding values are identical. The difference in column names ('total_bucket_1_count' vs. 'total_bucket_1_accounts') is semantically equivalent and acceptable per the evaluation criteria.                                                                              |
|            10 | Which state has the highest roll forward rate for the current month in DPD BKT 2?                                                                              |  66.6667 |          0.833333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data is a perfect match to the ground truth. Although a column is named 'total_bucket_2_count' instead of 'total_bucket_1_count', the values within the column are identical, leading to the correct final 'roll_forward_rate'. As per the evaluation criteria, column names are ignored when the underlying data values are correct.   |
|            11 | What is the current 90+ DPD percentage for the entire portfolio?                                                                                               | 100      |          0.766667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate correctly identified the 90+ DPD percentage as 7.16, which matches the ground truth value. Although the candidate result lacks the contextual columns present in the ground truth, it directly and accurately answers the user's specific question.                                                                                     |
|            12 | Show me the Vintage Curve for 30+ Delinquency for loans disbursed in Jan 2024, Feb 2024, and Mar 2024? At MOB = 3, 6, 9, 12.                                   | 100      |          0.723333 |              0 |             33.3333 | Numeric Exact Match                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            13 | Identify customers who have 'slipped' significantly: They were 0 DPD exactly one year ago but are 90+ DPD today?                                               |   0      |          0.686667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The AI returned a disaggregated list of individual customers, while the ground truth provides the correct aggregated summary. The user's question implies a need for a summary statistic (like a count or percentage of slipped customers), which the candidate data fails to provide.                                                                |
|            14 | Analyze the portfolio risk by Ticket Size: Amount Finance and show the 90+ DPD POS for each?                                                                   |   0      |          0.893333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies all the 'amtfin_band' categories, but the calculated values for the '90+ DPD POS' are incorrect for every single band. The discrepancies are significant and not due to floating-point precision. For instance, in the '>= 75K to < 100K' band, the candidate value is 3.96B while the ground truth is 2.30B. |
