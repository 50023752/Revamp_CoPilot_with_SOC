The row order is different, but this is acceptable as no specific ranking was requested. A minor floating-point difference (13.28 vs 13.27) is within the allowed tolerance.                                                              |

Show the number of cases.                             |  33.3333 |          0.853333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 10 dealers, their total cases, and NNS3 percentages, matching the ground truth exactly. The inclusion of an extra 'nns3_cases' column is acceptable as it provides additional helpful context without altering the core correctness of the answer. |
|             3 | Show me the top 10 dealers where banking model has highest no hit percentage? application count should be greater than 30 and what is the approval percentage? | 100      |          0.726667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 10 dealers and provides accurate calculations for both 'no banking hit percentage' and 'approval percentage'. All values match the ground truth, and the inclusion of extra columns with raw counts is acceptable and helpful.                     |
|             4 | SHow me the bounce rate on 0 dpd for Assam?                                                                                                                    | 100      |          0.716667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly provides the bounce rate of 21.61 for Assam, which matches the ground truth. Although the candidate data lacks the contextual columns present in the ground truth, it directly and accurately answers the user's specific question.                                   |
|             5 | What is the rejection based on CIBIL score below 650 in the last 3 months?

The user's question specifically requested data for the 'last 3 months', but the candidate provided 4 months of data.                                                                                                            |

While it correctly identifies the overall rejection rate and some specific rejection reasons, it omits the most frequent rejection reason, 'Unknown Reason', which accounts for 5250 out of 5265 rejected applications.                                          |

The additional columns providing the specific periods are considered helpful extra information.                                                                 |

The values are different.                                                                                                                                                                                |
