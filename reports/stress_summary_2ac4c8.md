|             1 | What is GNS4 trend for last 4 months?                                                                                                                          |       95 |            0.8035 |              0 |                  20 | LLM: The candidate data contains all the same rows as the ground truth data. The values are identical, with one minor and acceptable floating-point difference (13.28 vs 13.27). The difference in row order is ignored as per the evaluation criteria.                                                         |
|             2 | Give me top 10 dealer names that have the highest NNS3 percentage and cases are more than 30 per dealer? Show the number of cases.                             |       70 |            0.813  |              0 |                   5 | LLM: The candidate data failed to provide the 'dealer_name' as explicitly requested by the user, returning 'supplierid' instead. Furthermore, the top result from the ground truth ('SAI MOTORS') is completely missing from the candidate's result set, and an extra, incorrect record has been included.      |
|             3 | Show me the top 10 dealers where banking model has highest no hit percentage? application count should be greater than 30 and what is the approval percentage? |       45 |            0.9555 |              0 |                  10 | LLM: The candidate data is correct. It provides the same top 10 dealers with identical values for all metrics as the ground truth. The slight reordering of two dealers with the exact same 'no banking hit percentage' is acceptable as no secondary sort order was specified.                                 |
|             4 | SHow me the bounce rate on 0 dpd for Assam?                                                                                                                    |       85 |            0.766  |              0 |                   5 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the bounce rate as 21.61, which matches the ground truth. Although it lacks the contextual columns present in the ground truth, it directly and accurately answers the user's specific question.                                                                   |
