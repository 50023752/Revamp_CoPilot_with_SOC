The difference in row order is acceptable as the query did not explicitly ask for a specific sort order.                                                                                                                                                                   |

Show the number of cases.                             | 100      |          0.836667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 10 dealers and provides the required metrics (total cases and NNS3 percentage). The values for these core metrics perfectly match the ground truth. The inclusion of an extra column and different column names are acceptable per the evaluation criteria.                                                                                                                          |

All calculated values, including 'no hit percentage' and 'approval percentage', are accurate and match the ground truth. The inclusion of extra columns with raw counts is acceptable and does not detract from the correctness of the result.                                     |
|             4 | SHow me the bounce rate on 0 dpd for Assam?                                                                                                                    | 100      |          0.703333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the bounce rate of 21.61 for Assam, which matches the ground truth. Although the candidate data lacks the contextual columns for total and bounced accounts, it successfully extracts and presents the specific metric requested by the user.                                                                                                                                                |
|             5 | What is the rejection based on CIBIL score below 650 in the last 3 months? Month on month?                                                                     |  66.6667 |          0.98     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly provides the month-on-month rejection rates for applications with a CIBIL score below 650 for the last three months. All data points match the ground truth, and the difference in row order is acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|             6 | What is the rejection rate for applications where CIBIL score is between 300-650 in October 2025? Also list out the reason of rejections for these cases.      |  33.3333 |          0.906667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the overall rejection rate and provides an accurate breakdown of all rejection reasons and their respective counts. Although the format differs from the ground truth by omitting the summary row for total/rejected applications, all the core requested metrics and details are present and correct.                                                                                       |

The additional columns and row-based format provide helpful context without altering the core answer.                                                                                                                                                     |
|             8 | How many cases who were at 0 delinquency last year and now have slipped to 90+ ?                                                                               |   0      |          0.783333 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The aggregated value in the candidate data (60803) does not match the ground truth value (60734).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|             9 | Which state has the highest normalization rate for the current month in DPD BKT 1?                                                                             | 100      |          0.766667 |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the top 5 states and their corresponding metrics, perfectly matching the ground truth data. The candidate provides additional, correctly ranked rows, which can be considered a more comprehensive answer to the ranking-based question.                                                                                                                                                     |
|            10 | Which state has the highest roll forward rate for the current month in DPD BKT 2?                                                                              | 100      |          0.68     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly identifies the state with the highest roll forward rate and its corresponding values. The top 5 rows in the candidate data are a perfect match to the ground truth. The additional rows provided are supplementary and do not invalidate the answer.                                                                                                                                                    |

The values are significantly different and not within an acceptable precision tolerance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            12 | Show me the Vintage Curve for 30+ Delinquency for loans disbursed in Jan 2024, Feb 2024, and Mar 2024? At MOB = 3, 6, 9, 12.                                   |  66.6667 |          0.783333 |              0 |             33.3333 | Numeric Exact Match                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            13 | Identify customers who have 'slipped' significantly: They were 0 DPD exactly one year ago but are 90+ DPD today?                                               |   0      |          0.79     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data returned a completely different set of 'agreementno' values compared to the ground truth. Although the row count is the same, none of the identifiers match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            14 | Analyze the portfolio risk by Ticket Size: Amount Finance and show the 90+ DPD POS % for each? highest first.                                                  |   0      |          0.77     |              0 |             33.3333 | LLM: The candidate data correctly calculates the 'pos_90_plus' amount for each band. However, the 'total_pos' values are consistently incorrect, which leads to a miscalculation of the final 'dpd_90_plus_percentage'. For example, in the '>= 75K to < 100K' band, the ground truth 'total_pos' is 3.56e+10 resulting in an 11.11% DPD rate, whereas the candidate's 'total_pos' is 4.05e+10, resulting in an incorrect 9.79% DPD rate. |
